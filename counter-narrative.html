        <h1>Counter Narratives</h1>
        <p id="info-text">On June 25th, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea with the assistance of the Soviet Union and 
            China. The war lasted until July 27th, 1953 when both Koreas had the armistice agreement go into effect and 
            stopped the fighting. Even though they were tolerant of stopping the war, they both never officially signed a 
            peace treaty. Some still consider them war enemies, in fact.
            <br><br>
            Today, the often told story is about how the war took a small toll on the Koreas. Some even believe that the 
            Soviet Union and the US mainly contributed to it. In reality, the Koreas were so majorly affected by the Korean War. Over 4 million lives were taken, 
            and to remind you, 10.55 million people lived in North Korea and 19.22 million people lived in South Korea in 
            1950 (the beginning year of the war)!
