        <h1>Counter Narratives</h1>
        <p id="info-text">On June 25th, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea with the assistance of the Soviet Union and 
            China. The war lasted until July 27th, 1953 when both Koreas had the armistice agreement go into effect and 
            stopped the fighting. Even though they were tolerant of stopping the war, they both never officially signed a 
            peace treaty. Some still consider them war enemies, in fact.
