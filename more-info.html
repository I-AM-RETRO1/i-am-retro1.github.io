        <h1>More Info</h1>
        <h2>     On June 25th, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea with the assistance of the Soviet Union and China. The war lasted until July 27th, 1953 when both Koreas had the armistice agreement go into effect and stopped the fighting. Even though they were tolerant of stopping the war, they both never officially signed a peace treaty. Some still consider them war enemies, in fact.
            </h2>
            <h2>     Even with the different views of the US and Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), most people saw the Korean War as the smallest war in history, some even considered it just a major police act. A lot of what went into that was how the biggest war in history, WW2, had happened just a few years prior.
                 </h2>
                 <h2>     Today, the often told story is about how the war took a small toll on the Koreas. Some even believe that the Soviet Union and the US mainly contributed to it.
                 </h2>
                 <h2>     In reality, the Koreas were so majorly affected by the Korean War. Over 4 million lives were taken, and to remind you, 10.55 million people lived in North Korea and 19.22 million people lived in South Korea in 1950 (the beginning year of the war)!
