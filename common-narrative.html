        <h1>Common Narratives</h1>
        <p id="info-text">
            On June 25th, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea with the assistance of the Soviet 
            Union and China. The war lasted until July 27th, 1953 when both Koreas had the 
            armistice agreement go into effect and stopped the fighting. Even though they were 
            tolerant of stopping the war, they both never officially signed a peace treaty. Some 
            still consider them war enemies, in fact.<br><br>

            The common narrative typically tells the story that North Korea started the war when 
            they invaded South Korea after five years of gradual simmering tension. North Korea 
            received aid from the Soviet Union (Modern-day Russia) and South Korea was supported 
            by the U.S. The Soviet Union supported North Korea with strategic and grand tactical 
            planning (including the invasion which happened in South Korea), and essential 
            logistic support because of the shared liking of the communist system between them. 
            The U.S. provided South Korea with plenty of ground, air, naval forces, a police act 
            to support South Korea’s fight to freedom, and a supply of financial support which was 
            wealth that accounted for 80 percent of their overall government wealth because of 
            their shared dislikement of communism and liking of democracy.  After three years of 
            continuous battle, neither side securely took the title of victory after the war. 
            The two countries came out satisfied after they settled their tolerance of each-other 
            as coexisting communist and non-communist countries. However, both sides thought this 
            war as the smallest war in history, going as far to refer to it as “Just a police act.” 
            <br><br>
            The story that is typically told leads people to believe that the Korean war was a 
            small war with very little impact on Korea. Most people blame America or the Soviet 
            Union for a lot of the actions which happened in the Korean peninsula. Additionally, 
            some even refer to it as just a police action or the smallest war ever. Most people 
            believe that the war ended with a peace treaty between the two countries. The dominant 
            perspective impacts society today because it can give us a view on another country and 
            their people because of their past actions in history. Additionally, getting one 
            perspective can lead us to disrespect or diminish the value of a perspective of someone
            different. Additionally, we can get historical facts wrong because of a perspective we’re 
            shown. We also get a bias or opinion on the wars or importance of an event based off of an 
            event such as this. As a student without proper knowledge, I could develop an opinion that 
            could absolutely offend Koreans, their relatives, and their culture.

            The story of the counter-narrative or counter perspective is that the Korean war was detrimental to the two nations with over 2 million deaths. The Soviet Union, China and the US were not as involved as people may have thought. The nations believed their conflict as an inner war to be resolved by themselves, even while supporting them. Additionally, the Korean war was an influence on the U.S. 's, Britain’s, and the United Nation;s  political and ideological questions around the world. Additionally, the Koreas never signed a peace treaty which means that people can consider them to have an ongoing war.
            <br><br>
            Even with the different views of the US and Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), most people saw the Korean War as 
            the smallest war in history, some even considered it just a major police act. A lot of what went into that was 
            how the biggest war in history, World War 2, had happened just a few years prior.
